### ¡Hola gente bella del mundo digital!


## My name is **Sergio Sarmiento** 🦝


I have spent the last couple of years learning to code  **</>** . 


Although I'm no expert, I have become very familiar with:

**• HTML**

**• CSS**

**• Javascript**

**• Node**

**• MongoDB**


And also a bit of:

**• React**

**• Python**

**• PHP**

**• SQL**


I guess I could say my preferred stack nowadays is the MERN/MEAN stack, but most importantly, I try to keep myself busy **LEARNING**


Feel free to look around
