### ¡Hola gente bella del mundo digital!

## My name is Sergio Sarmiento 🦝

# I have spent the last couple of years learning to code ** </> **. 

# Although I'm no expert, I have become very familiar with:

## • HTML
## • CSS
## • Javascript
## • Node
## • MongoDB

# And also a bit of:
## • React
## • Python
## • PHP
## • SQL

# I guess I could say myy preferred stack nowadays is the MERN/MEAN stack, but most importantly, I try to keep myself busy **LEARNING**

# Feel free to explore and, if you happen to find anything of your liking (be sure to check my [portfolio](https://gersiomarsiento.github.io/portfolio/) 😉), be sure to [contact me](mailto:sergioezequielsarmiento@gmail.com) 📧!
